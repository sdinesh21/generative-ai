    "# Exploring Gemini 2.0 Flash Model - Streaming Response\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Google's python-genai SDK to interact with the Gemini 2.0 Flash model with streaming responses. Streaming is particularly useful for:\n",
    "- Real-time applications where you want to show responses as they're generated\n",
    "- Long-form content generation where you want to see progress\n",
    "- Interactive applications that need to display partial results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Gemini API key:\n",
    "   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)\n",
    "   - Click on 'Get API key' in the top right\n",
    "   - Create a new API key or use an existing one\n",
    "   - Copy the API key for use in step 2\n",

    "- How to set up streaming with the Gemini model\n",
    "- How to process and display streaming responses\n",
    "- Understanding the differences between streaming and basic responses"
